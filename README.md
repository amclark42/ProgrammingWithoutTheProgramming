# “Programming without the Programming” workshop resources

The purpose of this workshop to teach people some of the constructs common to programming languages. I wanted to reach people without formal training in Computer Science, and as such decided against taking up any one particular language. Instead, I decided that pseudocode would be most useful, both because it is expressed in a familiar natural language, and because writing pseudocode is a skill that (in my admittedly-limited experience) often goes untaught in Computer Science classes. I hoped that this approach would be accessible to people across the spectrum of comfort with programming.

“Programming without the Programming” was taught on Wednesday, February 20th, 2019, at the Digital Humanities (DH) Open Office Hours in Northeastern University’s Snell Library. Many thanks to Megan Barney, who coordinated the event, and without whom there would be no workshop.
